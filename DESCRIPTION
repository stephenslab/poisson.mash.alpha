Description: Implements Poisson multivariate adaptive shrinkage
    ("Poisson mash") for analyzing count data obtained in different
    conditions or treatments. Poisson mash takes an empirical Bayes
    approach to testing and effect estimation; it estimates patterns of
    similarity among conditions, then exploits these patterns to improve
    accuracy of the effect estimates. This is an adaptation of the mash
    package that is better suited fo modeling count data in a range of 
    realistic settings.
